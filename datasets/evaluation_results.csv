In general, these works are focused on the determination of: (i) \nthe total content of polyphenols ( Andres-Lacueva et al., 2008 ; Gu et al., \n2006 ; Gültekin-\n¨\nOzgüven et al., 2016 ; Hurst et al., 2011 ; Joli ´c et al., \n2011 ; Kofink et al., 2007 ; Li et al., 2014 ; Miller et al., 2008 ; Payne et al., \n2010 ; Quelal-V ´asconez et al., 2020 ; Rodriguez et al., 2009 ; Stanley et al., \n2015 ; Stark & Hofmann, 2006 ; Todorovic et al., 2017 ), (ii) the mineral \ncontent ( Adeyeye et al., 2016 ) (iii) the volatile composition ( Alasti et al., \n2019 , 2020 ; Li et al., 2012 ) or (iv) the effect of alkalization on Maillard \nproducts ( Tas ¸ & G ¨okmen, 2016 ). However, these studies are based on \nthe determination of a specific class of compounds and just a few articles \nhave reported the characterization of a wide variety of compounds \nincluding volatile and nonvolatile compounds ( Li et al., 2012 ; Sioriki \net al., 2022 ) or the identification of new compounds as a result of \nalkalization treatment ( Germann et al., 2019a , 2019b ). For this reason, a \ndeeper study focused on a more comprehensive analysis of the set of \nmetabolites could provide relevant information to evaluate changes in \nthe metabolic profile of cocoa powder samples submitted to different \nalkalization degrees. In this regard, “ omics ” techniques have gained \nimportance in the last years due to the extensive information that they \nprovide about a biological system. From the perspective of Food Science, \nmetabolomics aims to provide information regarding the quality, safety, \nand traceability of foods and food products. LC-MS is the most common \nanalytical platform for untargeted metabolomic studies ( Castro-Puyana \net al., 2017 ; Zhong et al., 2022 ). To the best of our knowledge, there are \nno metabolomics-based strategies reported in the literature focused on \nthe study of the effect of the alkalization process on cocoa powder. \nBearing in mind that the alkalization process to what the cocoa \nsamples are submitted may lead to chemical transformations modifying \nthe cocoa composition, and therefore its nutritional, sensory, and \nmicrobiological characteristics, this work was focused on implementing \na UHPLC-QTOF-MS untargeted metabolomics approach to study the \nmetabolomic profile of cocoa powder samples submitted to different \nalkalization degrees. In this way, it would be possible to perform a \ncomprehensive metabolomics analysis to identify those metabolites \nshowing significant differences along the alkalization degrees, which \ncan be considered as potential markers of the alkalization process. \n2.

This process has also\npreviously described to affect cocoa's composition.\n( Goya, Kongor, & de Pascual-Teresa, 2022 ). Cocoa contains three\nprimary categories of polyphenols, including flavanols such as catechin,\nepicatechin, and gallocatechin; anthocyanins (leucoanthocyanins and\ncyanidins); and proanthocyanidins (dimers, trimers, and other polymers\nof flavan-3-ols). To a lesser extent, cocoa also contains flavones, such as\napigenin, luteolin, and kaempferol, alongside phenolic acids, such as\ncaffeic and chlorogenic acids. These compounds are associated with a\nrange of advantages for the cardiovascular system, including lowering\ninsulin resistance and anti-inflammatory properties, but also with pos-\nitive impacts on gut microbiota, and the improvement of cognitive\nfunction ( Palma-Morales, Melgar-Locatelli, Castilla-Ortega, & Rodrí-\nguez-P ´erez, 2023 ; Razola-Díaz et al., 2023 ). However, according to their\nstructures and chemical modifications, polyphenols have different sen-\nsory characteristics and are recognized as pigmenting, astringent, and\nbitter compounds, with the capacity to alter the cocoa taste ( Valverde\nGarcía et al., 2020 ). Cocoa also contains methylxanthines, such as\ntheobromine, caffeine, and theophylline, which influence its taste by\nconferring astringency and bitterness, and has also been associated with\nbeneficial physiological and psychological effects ( Goya et al., 2022 ).\nHowever, the composition of cocoa varies considerably depending on its\ngenotype, geographic location, farming techniques, environmental fac-\ntors, and post-harvesting operations, among other factors ( Kadow, 2020 ;\nPalma-Morales et al., 2023 ; Razola-Díaz et al., 2023 ; Valverde García\net al., 2020 ). Processing, particularly alkalization, can reduce the pres-\nence of phenolic compounds and methylxanthines, potentially affecting\nthe health-related attributes of the cocoa ( Goya et al., 2022 ). For the\ncomprehensive study of cocoa composition and to understand how\nprocessing, such as alkalization, affect it, metabolomics emerges as a\npotent tool for the search for biomarkers related to the quality,\nauthenticity, safety, and traceability of food products ( Selamat, Rozani,\n& Murugesu, 2021 ). Targeted metabolomics approaches have been used\nto identify specific compounds of interest in cacao, such as polyphenols,\ncatechins, flavonoids, and methylxanthines. A suitable method for\nanalyzing the chemical composition forms the basis for comprehensively\ninvestigating the composition of cocoa. Liquid chromatography-tandem\nmass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as the primary technique\nfor scrutinizing the chemical makeup of plant-based foods owing to its\nremarkable precision and sensitivity ( Tong et al., 2021 ).

ABSTRACT  
This work is focused on the study of the metabolomic changes that occur in cocoa powder throughout the 
alkalization process by using an untargeted ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high- 
resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) metabolomics approach. With this aim, cocoa powder sam -
ples submitted to different alkalization degrees (light, medium, and strong) were analyzed. Metabolite extraction 
was performed using 75% MeOH in water since it provided the highest number of molecular features. After data 
processing, non-supervised and supervised methods were applied to carry out the statistical data analysis. Thus, 
the most significant metabolites that allow establishing differences among the cocoa powder samples submitted 
to the alkalization processes were pointed out. Thus, 43 and 30 metabolites in positive and negative ionization 
modes, respectively, demonstrated to be relevant. Among them, 9 compounds were unequivocally identified and 
22 tentatively identified. Most of them were amino acids, alkaloids, organic acids or polyphenols, among others.   
1. Introduction 
Cocoa is a highly valued product, consumed all over the world not 
only for its pleasant flavor and aroma but also for the nutritional and 
health benefits that it presents. These properties make cocoa a suitable 
ingredient in the food industry and personal care products. Despite the 
sweet flavor of chocolate (the most known cocoa-based product) cocoa 
is characterized by presenting acidity, astringency, and bitterness 
properties. These non-desirable properties could be reduced using an 
alkalization (or dutching) process ( Sioriki et al., 2021 ; Valverde et al., 
2020 ) which is based on the combination of an alkali solution (usually 
NaOH and K

in concentration from 1 to 6%) with cocoa. A partic -
ular temperature, (from 60 to 130 
◦
C), and pressure (from 0.10 to 1.22 
MPa) are applied during a period between 5 and 180 min ( Valve -
rde-García et al., 2020 ). In general, the final product is classified ac -
cording to its pH value, which may range from pH 5.0 to pH 8.0. In this 
way, the product is labeled as dark natural if the pH is between 5.0 and 
6.0, light alkalized cocoa when the pH is from 6.0 to 7.2, medium 
alkalized cocoa when the pH range is between 7.2 and 7.6, and strongly 
alkalized cocoa when the product has a pH value higher than 7.6 ( Miller 
et al., 2008 ). The use of the different alkalized cocoa powders depends 
on the final application of the product: natural and light alkalized cocoa 
powders are employed to produce chocolate, ice creams, and cocoa 
beverages whereas medium and strong alkalized cocoa powders are 
mainly used to prepare ice creams and bakery products such as cookies 
or cakes ( Valverde-García et al., 2020 ).

Conclusion\nIn summary, this study investigated how alkalization affects the\ncompositions of different commercial cocoa powders. It is worth high-\nlighting the advantage of using a non-targeted method, as it allows for a\nbroad coverage of metabolites, enabling the identification of several\nsecondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, alkaloids terpenoids or\neven fungal-related metabolites, lipids and amino acids.
