Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.\nKEY WORDS:\n● anthocyanin ● metabolite ● elderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n● blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\nAnthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread\ngroup of plant constituents known collectively as ﬂavonoids.\nThey are mainly distributed among ﬂowers, fruits and vegeta-\nbles and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in\nﬂower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can\nbe used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited\nbecause of their poor stability. As a potential major compo-\nnent of our daily diet (4), more and more research has con-\ncentrated on their biological activities and possible health\nbeneﬁts in protecting against some chronic diseases, including\ncancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and dia-\nbetes. Some of these biological activities and protective func-\ntions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities\n(5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that\nthey could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal che-\nlation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\nTo evaluate the health beneﬁts of ACN in humans, the\nbioavailibility including absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nand excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider\nthe metabolites (such as ring-ﬁssion products produced by\nmicroorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.)\ninstead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the\nconcentration of the original forms in human body is much\nless than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contrib-\nute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However,\ninformation about metabolism of ACN is quite limited.\nAs early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of\nrabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from\ngrapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN\nor anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the\ncirculation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,\nwere long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body']","The study focuses on the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of anthocyanins (ACN) in elderly women after consuming either 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) or 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB).

Murkovic and coworkers (20 –22) studied the absorp-\ntion and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that\nACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood\nand urine as intact glycosides.

Anthocyanins, found in fruits and vegetables, have been shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals. This property makes them effective antioxidants and beneficial for maintaining cellular health.",Analista Junior,PERFECT_GRAMMAR,LONG,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
