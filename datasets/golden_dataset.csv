It reduces astringency and alters its\ncomposition, particularly in the phenolic compound content, which is related to cocoa health benefits. This study\naimed to investigate the impact of alkalization on the composition of seven commercial cocoa powders. A liquid\nchromatography-based metabolomic approach was employed to assess the metabolic differences between\nalkalized and non-alkalized cocoa powders. Supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis\n(OPLS-DA) was used to identify the most discriminating variables between groups. A feature-based molecular\nnetwork (FBMN) was used to explore the chemical space. Three hundred forty-seven metabolites were obtained\nas the most discriminant, among which 60 were tentatively annotated. Phenolic compounds, lysophosphatidy-\nlethanolamines, amino acids, and their derivatives were significantly reduced in alkalized cocoas. In contrast,\nfatty acids and their derivatives significantly increased with alkalization. Despite the variability among com-\nmercial cocoas, chemometrics allowed the elucidation of alterations induced specifically by alkalization in their\ncomposition.\n1. Introduction\nCocoa is a widely distributed and globally recognized product. Its\ncolor, flavor, functional compounds, and established health benefits\ncollectively contribute to its high regard as a favored food among con-\nsumers and industries. Cocoa beans are extracted and fermented from\nthe harvested cocoa pods of Theobroma cacao to obtain nibs. The nibs,\nwhich are unshelled and fermented cocoa seeds, represent the final\nproduct of the primary cocoa production process. They are ground to\nobtain a paste called “ cocoa liquor ” . Cocoa liquor is pressed and divided\ninto a solid part, known as “ cocoa cake ” and an oily part, “ cocoa butter ” .\nThe cake is processed into “ cocoa powder ” . Cocoa powder is recognized\nfor its light color, low solubility, and acidic, astringent, and bitter taste.\nAlkalization is a process used to enhance cocoa powder solubility;\nmoreover it has the capacity to modify color and flavor.
