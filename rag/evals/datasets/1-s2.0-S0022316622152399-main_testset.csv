What is the significance of sample preparation in the study of anthocyanins?,"['Human Nutrition and Metabolism\n\nAbsorption and Metabolism of Anthocyanins in Elderly Women after Consumption of Elderberry or Blueberry\n\nXianli Wu,* Guohua Cao† and Ronald L. Prior1,3\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center, Little Rock, AR 72202 and †U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts, Boston 02111\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB) (690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 ± 90 mg (mean ± SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 ± 10.9 mg (mean ± SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.

They are mainly distributed among flowers, fruits and vegetables and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in flower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited because of their poor stability. As a potential major component of our daily diet (4), more and more research has concentrated on their biological activities and possible health benefits in protecting against some chronic diseases, including cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Some of these biological activities and protective functions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities (5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal chelation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\n\nTo evaluate the health benefits of ACN in humans, the bioavailability including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider the metabolites (such as ring-fission products produced by microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.) instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the concentration of the original forms in human body is much less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contribute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However, information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited. As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides, were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body unless they were hydrolyzed by intestinal microorganisms. Recently, several papers on the absorption and metabolism of dietary ACN have shown that ACN can be absorbed in experimental animals and humans as glycosides (12–23). We have previously detected the intact glycoside forms in blood and urine of humans after consuming elderberry ACN (16–17). Murkovic and coworkers (20–22) studied the absorption and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that ACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood and urine as intact glycosides. This report documents that additional ACN metabolites are present in humans after consumption of ACN from an elderberry extract or whole blueberry.\n\n0022-3166/02 $3.00 © 2002 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

The 3-O-β-glucoside of pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin (six mixed ACN standard, HPLC grade), and cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (HPLC grade) were obtained from Polyphenols Laboratories (Sandnes, Norway); methanol from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ); formic acid from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and β-glucuronidase from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO); Sep-Pak Vac RC (500 mg) C₁₈ Cartridges for solid-phase extraction (SPE) were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA).\n\nSubjects and study design. The study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee of Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, and written, informed consent was obtained from each study participant.\n\nFor the elderberry study, four healthy women, 60–70 y old, consumed 12 g elderberry extract that contained a total of 720 mg of ACN blended in 500 mL water after fasting overnight as described previously (17). Urine samples were collected from these subjects before the consumption of elderberry extract and between 0 and 2, 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12, and 12 and 24 h after consumption of the elderberry extract. The urine samples were treated with 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2, v/v) and then stored at -70°C before analysis.\n\nFor the blueberry study, six healthy elderly women, 60–70 y old, were given 189 g frozen lowbush blueberry (BB) (containing a total of 690 mg of ACN) blended in 315 mL water after fasting overnight. The urine samples were collected and treated as described above. Blood samples were collected before and at 10, 20, 30, 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after consumption of blueberry. The blood samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then plasma samples were quickly removed and immediately treated with an aqueous solution of 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2; v/v). These samples were stored in -70°C until analysis.\n\nSample preparation.\n\nThe urine samples were treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as follows. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL methanol, and then equilibrated with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. Urine samples (5 mL) were loaded onto the cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. ACN were recovered with 5 mL 5% formic acid/methanol solution. The methanol solution was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY) and redissolved in 200 μL 5% formic acid methanol solution. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for analysis of ACN.\n\nBlood samples were also treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as previously described (16). After SPE treatment, water-soluble compounds, polar lipids, and neutral lipids were removed from the plasma samples. ACN were eluted finally with 5 mL of 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. The methanol phase was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant) and redissolved in 200 μL 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for the analysis of ACN.\n\nBefore experimental samples were prepared, blank urine and blood samples spiked with cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside were prepared using the same procedures to test the recovery of the sample preparation method.\n\nAnalysis of ACN in urine and plasma.\n\nThe analysis of ACN in urine was carried out on an HP series 1100 HPLC system including an autosampler, a binary pump, Zorbax SB-C₁₈ column (4.6 × 250 mm), and a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Elution was performed using mobile phase A (5% formic acid aqueous solution) and mobile phase B (pure methanol). The flow rate was 1 mL/min and detection was at 520 nm. The gradient system used was as follows: 0–2 min, 5% B; 2–10 min, 5–20% B; 10–15 min, 20% B; 15–30 min, 20–30% B; 30–35 min, 30% B; 35–50 min, 30–45% B; 50–55 min, 45% B; 55–65 min, 45–5% B; and 65–68 min, 5% B.\n\nLow-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with an Esquire-LC Mass Spectrometer (MS) (Bruker Daltoniks, Billerica, MA), an ion trap instrument equipped with an electrospray interface. Column effluent was monitored in positive mode of the MS. Major MS parameters were: capillary exit, 3500 V; capillary offset, 500 V.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRecovery tests.\n\nResults of recovery tests on SPE of cyanidin-3-glucoside from urine was 90.0 ± 1.5% (n = 3); the recovery of cyanidin-3-glucoside on SPE from plasma was 91.4 ± 0.9% (n = 3).\n\nElderberry study.\n\nNo ACN peaks were detected in urine samples collected before consumption of the elderberry extract (Fig. 1A). In all samples collected from the four women after they consumed the elderberry extract, a relatively large peak at 520 nm was observed in the chromatogram with a retention time of 27 min (Fig. 1B). Compared with the profile of the mixed standard of six ACN (Fig. 1C), it appeared that this peak contained cyanidin-3-glucoside. The enlarged chromatogram indicated that it contained two peaks (Fig. 2A, Peaks 1 and 2). From the mass spectral data (Fig. 2B), we found one of them, which was eluted a little bit earlier than the other, has a molecular weight of 581.0 (mass-to-charge ratio, or m/z: 581.0). Its daughter fragment ion had an m/z of 287.2 from the MS/MS data (Fig. 2B). The other coeluting peak had an m/z of 449.1, with a daughter fragment peak with an m/z of 287.2. Comparing their elution times, spectra, and data from the previous paper (17), we identified these two peaks as cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. They are the major ACN that account for 90% of the total ACN in elderberry (24) and cyanidin is the only ACN aglycone present in elderberry (25).\n\nThere were some additional small peaks with retention times of 33–36 min. Their spectra indicated that they were also ACN. Their structures were further confirmed by MS.\n\nFIGURE 1 RP-HPLC chromatograms of urine samples from subject G before (A) and 0–2 h after consuming the elderberry extract (B). Chromatogram C is of six mixed anthocyanins: delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside from left to right on the chromatogram.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS\n\n1867\n\nmAU\n\nPeak 2 uronide residue, which is a very common conjugated form of flavonoids in humans (26). This peak may be peonidin mono-glucuronide. However, we could not determine the exact site of glucuronidation on the peonidin from the available data. Subject G, 0-2 hour Two other small peaks (Peaks 8 and 9) which eluted earlier than Peak 7 were not identified because of their low concentrations. There was another glucuronide conjugated form with a retention time of 19.8 min on the subject G chromatogram (0 –2 h) (Fig. 4B, Peak 10). MS spectral results indicated an m/z of 625.3 and MS/MS data gave two fragments with an m/z of 463.1 and 287.2. (Fig. 4B). An m/z of 287.2 is typical for cyanidin aglycone, and 463.1 minus 287.2 is 176, which is indicative of a glucuronide residue. The difference between 463.1 and the m/z of the parent compound (625.3) is 162.2, which matches that of a hexose residue. Because only cyanidin-3-glucoside is present in elderberry, this peak should be the monoglucuronide form of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a compound which has four free hydroxyl groups. The exact glucuronidation site on cyanidin is not known. Two other peaks in the same chromatogram (Peaks 11 and 12) were not identified. They were not typical ACN based on their MS spectral data. Not all metabolites were detected in all subjects. A summary of the MS data and total urinary excretion is shown in Table 1.\n\nBlueberry study. Urine samples from the five women who consumed blueberry had ACN in their urine. However, the ACN concentrations were much lower than those in the women who consumed elderberry. When we tried to identify ACN with MS, we were unable to detect the ACN signal separate from the background signals. We used the blueberry.\n\nmAU\n\nPeak Peak 3 Subject G, 0-2 hour 4 Peonidin 3-glucoside Peak 5 0.8 Peonidin 3-sambubioside Peak 6\n\nIntens32 33 34 35 36 37 min\n\nx105}$ + All MS, 33.1min (#569) B\n\n102.2 301.5 421.1 468.3 595.9 151.1 232.2 361.8 549.3 629.8\n\nx10⁹ MS/MS(595), 33.2min (#570)\n\n301.2\n\n121.6 193.9 233.6 412.6 478.6 539.7 606.7 675.7 713.3\n\n463.1 + All MS, 34.4min (#591)\n\n119.3 301.0 534.3 706.5 206.3 261.4 371.3 427.3 603.9 669.0\n\n301.2 + MS/MS(463), 34.5min (#592)\n\n613.3\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 m/z\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of anthocyanins (ACN) metabolites in the urine sample from subject G (0–2 h).

By means of HPLC-MS/MS and comparing with previous studies, we identified 22 ACN in the blueberry food sample. We found several ACN in urine samples when comparing to the blueberry sample. Total urinary excretions were 7.62 ± 5.00, 10.07 ± 3.28, 5.56 ± 5.07, and 23.25 ± 10.88 mg for 0 –2 h, 2– 4h, 4 – 6 h, and 0 – 6 h, respectively (n = 5). The total excreted accounted for 0.004% (wt/wt) of the amount consumed. We also compared the urinary ACN excretion to ACN in the meal. The results are shown in Figure 5. The relative proportions of the different ACN were similar except for the arabinose forms of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin. We did not detect any ACN peaks in plasma at 520 nm from 2 mL of sample in any of the subjects.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nIdentification and excretion (0 – 4 h) of anthocyanins in the urine of elderly women consuming elderberry extract\n\nCompound MS (m/z) MS/MS (m/z) Subject B (mg/4 h) Subject G (mg/4 h) Subject J (mg/4 h) Subject R (mg/4 h) Cyanidin–3-sambubioside 581.2 287.2 417.12 498.21 388.70 360.022 Cyanidin–3-glucoside 449.1 287.2 Peonidin–3-glucoside 463.3 301.2 64.22 66.98 26.00 31.62 Peonidin–3-sambubioside 595.9 301.2 ND 29.53 ND ND Peonidin monoglucuronide 477.1 301.2 142.25 ND ND 95.10 Cyanidin–3-glucoside monoglucuronide 625.3 463.1/287.2 ND 40.27 50.77 ND Total (mg) 627.89 634.99 465.47 486.74 Mean ± SD (mg) 553.77 ± 90.15 Total excretion (% intake) 0.087 0.088 0.065 0.068 Mean ± SD (% intake) 0.077 ± 0.013\n\n1 Quantities calculated based upon either cyanidin- or peonidin-3-glucoside standards.\n\n2 Cyanidin–3-sambubioside and cyanidin–3-glucoside appeared as one peak; the values of this line include both of them and calculated as cyanidin–3-glucoside equivalent.\n\n3 Not detected.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS lower detection limit under our current conditions would be 0.005 mg/L (based on cyanidin-3-glucoside).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nACN have been considered to not be absorbed in the human body, unless they were first hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the gastrointestinal tract. The poor lipophilic properties of ACN have led to the conviction that they are underabsorbed. Horwitt (11) was perhaps the first to observe the ACN pigments in the urine of rabbits. Recently, however, several investigators have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in both human and animal bodies as intact forms (12–23). Some investigators have shown that quercetin glucosides may interact with the intestinal glucose transporter and be absorbed in that manner (28–30). Whether ACN could be absorbed by a similar mechanism remains unknown. Müller et al. (22) compared the urinary excretion when elderberry ACN were consumed with and without simultaneous ingestion of sugar. The total excretion of ACN with sugar was lower than that without sugar, indicating that sugar carriers might play a role in flavonoid absorption. The presence of the sambubioside form gives strong credence to this as it is unlikely that the sambubioside form could be reformed from the aglycone after its absorption.\n\nPrevious studies have also indicated that methylation is an established pathway in the metabolism of flavonoids (26). For several flavonoids with 3, 4-dihydroxylation of ring B, conjugates of their 3-O-methyl ethers were excreted (31–32). This transformation occurred in the liver and was catalyzed by catechol-O-methyl transferase (14,33). Cyanidin is an anthocyanidin with a 3, 4-dihydroxylation pattern of ring B. We detected peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in the urine from humans. Miyazawa et al. (15) found a methylated form of an ACN in liver of rats and the concentration of the methylated form was much higher than the original form in the liver, but they did not detect it in plasma and urine. They (15) assumed that these methylated compounds were excreted from the liver into bile directly. However, we detected the methylated form of ACN in the urine of humans. Thus, they must appear in the blood and be excreted by the kidney.\n\nConjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are considered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds. They are also the common final steps in the metabolic pathway of flavonoids in mammalian systems (26,34). These modifications could start in the small intestine, liver, or kidney (35–36). UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and sulfotransferase in the liver would likely be responsible for this conjugation (26,37). So far, many different subclasses of flavonoids have been found to be absorbed and excreted as glucuronide forms in both humans and experimental animals (26,35,37,38). But for ACN, no glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms have been found in urine or plasma of either humans or experimental animals. This observation is completely different from other flavonoids, such as catechin and epicatechin, or isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein, whose basic structures are similar to ACN. Miyazawa et al. (15) assumed that the flavylium cation structure of ACN may impart resistance to such enzymatic conversion into conjugates.\n\nIn our studies we detected the glucuronide conjugate forms for the first time. These results indicate that ACN might share some of the same metabolic pathways with other flavonoid compounds. Perhaps, others did not detect them because of the low concentrations of these metabolites. We detected and tentatively identified them using diode–array detector and MS. We were unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with the enzyme β-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min). Hydrolysis of the conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in that ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared completely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h. Because previous investigators have relied on detecting the conjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations before and after incubation with β-glucuronidase, small amounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any conjugates that were present.\n\nIn this study, we still do not know how the peonidin monoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could describe the formation of this metabolite (Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-glucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to form peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).\n\nEither cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could serve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form the corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this to occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would have to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique enzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-glucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination (39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine of the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis would explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This pathway seems likely since we have found all of these compounds in urine.\n\nA second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and absorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and conjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cyanidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid (14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of humans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat jejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to find peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we have not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is that we are generally working near the limits of detection of\n\nOMe\n\nOH HO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nCyanidin aglycone Peonidin aglycone\n\nOH OMe OH\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside + CH,OH Peonidin monoglucuronide\n\nOH Pathway 2\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside monoglucuronide Peonidin 3-glucoside\n\nOMe\n\nCOOH\n\nOH\n\nPeonidin 3-glucuronide\n\nPathway 1\n\nFIGURE 6 Glucuronide conjugated forms from cyanidin-3-glucoside.

It is clear from all but one of these studies that the recovery of ACN or ACN metabolites in urine is quite low (0.004 – 0.11% of dose). The one study in which urinary excretion was much higher (13) involved subjects who consumed wine and the “ACN-like” compounds which absorbed at 520 nm and were not well characterized. It may be that ACN in wine are absorbed to a much greater extent than from berries or berry juices or extracts.\n\nIn summary, we observed for the first time the presence of glucuronide forms of ACN, namely peonidin monoglucuronide and cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide, in the urine of humans after the consumption of elderberry ACN. We observed the apparent methylation of both cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside to peonidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-sambubioside. We were unable to detect ACN in plasma from women who consumed a single meal of blueberries; however, they were detectable in the urine but the quantities were quite low, with the total amount excreted during the first 6 h being only 0.004% of the quantity consumed.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nMazza, G. & Miniati, E.

"How do chemicals and materials play a role in the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins in humans, particularly in the context of the study involving elderberry and blueberry consumption?","['Human Nutrition and Metabolism\n\nAbsorption and Metabolism of Anthocyanins in Elderly Women after Consumption of Elderberry or Blueberry\n\nXianli Wu,* Guohua Cao† and Ronald L. Prior1,3\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center, Little Rock, AR 72202 and †U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts, Boston 02111\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB) (690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 ± 90 mg (mean ± SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 ± 10.9 mg (mean ± SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.

Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.\n\nKEY WORDS:\n\nanthocyanin\n\nmetabolite\n\nelderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n\nblueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\n\nAnthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread group of plant constituents known collectively as flavonoids. They are mainly distributed among flowers, fruits and vegetables and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in flower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited because of their poor stability. As a potential major component of our daily diet (4), more and more research has concentrated on their biological activities and possible health benefits in protecting against some chronic diseases, including cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Some of these biological activities and protective functions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities (5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal chelation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\n\nTo evaluate the health benefits of ACN in humans, the bioavailability including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider the metabolites (such as ring-fission products produced by microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.) instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the concentration of the original forms in human body is much less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contribute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However, information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited. As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides, were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body unless they were hydrolyzed by intestinal microorganisms. Recently, several papers on the absorption and metabolism of dietary ACN have shown that ACN can be absorbed in experimental animals and humans as glycosides (12–23). We have previously detected the intact glycoside forms in blood and urine of humans after consuming elderberry ACN (16–17). Murkovic and coworkers (20–22) studied the absorption and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that ACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood and urine as intact glycosides. This report documents that additional ACN metabolites are present in humans after consumption of ACN from an elderberry extract or whole blueberry.\n\n0022-3166/02 $3.00 © 2002 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

The 3-O-β-glucoside of pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin (six mixed ACN standard, HPLC grade), and cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (HPLC grade) were obtained from Polyphenols Laboratories (Sandnes, Norway); methanol from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ); formic acid from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and β-glucuronidase from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO); Sep-Pak Vac RC (500 mg) C₁₈ Cartridges for solid-phase extraction (SPE) were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA).\n\nSubjects and study design. The study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee of Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, and written, informed consent was obtained from each study participant.\n\nFor the elderberry study, four healthy women, 60–70 y old, consumed 12 g elderberry extract that contained a total of 720 mg of ACN blended in 500 mL water after fasting overnight as described previously (17). Urine samples were collected from these subjects before the consumption of elderberry extract and between 0 and 2, 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12, and 12 and 24 h after consumption of the elderberry extract. The urine samples were treated with 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2, v/v) and then stored at -70°C before analysis.\n\nFor the blueberry study, six healthy elderly women, 60–70 y old, were given 189 g frozen lowbush blueberry (BB) (containing a total of 690 mg of ACN) blended in 315 mL water after fasting overnight. The urine samples were collected and treated as described above. Blood samples were collected before and at 10, 20, 30, 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after consumption of blueberry. The blood samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then plasma samples were quickly removed and immediately treated with an aqueous solution of 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2; v/v). These samples were stored in -70°C until analysis.\n\nSample preparation.\n\nThe urine samples were treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as follows. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL methanol, and then equilibrated with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. Urine samples (5 mL) were loaded onto the cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. ACN were recovered with 5 mL 5% formic acid/methanol solution. The methanol solution was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY) and redissolved in 200 μL 5% formic acid methanol solution. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for analysis of ACN.\n\nBlood samples were also treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as previously described (16). After SPE treatment, water-soluble compounds, polar lipids, and neutral lipids were removed from the plasma samples. ACN were eluted finally with 5 mL of 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. The methanol phase was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant) and redissolved in 200 μL 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for the analysis of ACN.\n\nBefore experimental samples were prepared, blank urine and blood samples spiked with cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside were prepared using the same procedures to test the recovery of the sample preparation method.\n\nAnalysis of ACN in urine and plasma.\n\nThe analysis of ACN in urine was carried out on an HP series 1100 HPLC system including an autosampler, a binary pump, Zorbax SB-C₁₈ column (4.6 × 250 mm), and a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Elution was performed using mobile phase A (5% formic acid aqueous solution) and mobile phase B (pure methanol). The flow rate was 1 mL/min and detection was at 520 nm. The gradient system used was as follows: 0–2 min, 5% B; 2–10 min, 5–20% B; 10–15 min, 20% B; 15–30 min, 20–30% B; 30–35 min, 30% B; 35–50 min, 30–45% B; 50–55 min, 45% B; 55–65 min, 45–5% B; and 65–68 min, 5% B.\n\nLow-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with an Esquire-LC Mass Spectrometer (MS) (Bruker Daltoniks, Billerica, MA), an ion trap instrument equipped with an electrospray interface. Column effluent was monitored in positive mode of the MS. Major MS parameters were: capillary exit, 3500 V; capillary offset, 500 V.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRecovery tests.\n\nResults of recovery tests on SPE of cyanidin-3-glucoside from urine was 90.0 ± 1.5% (n = 3); the recovery of cyanidin-3-glucoside on SPE from plasma was 91.4 ± 0.9% (n = 3).\n\nElderberry study.\n\nNo ACN peaks were detected in urine samples collected before consumption of the elderberry extract (Fig. 1A). In all samples collected from the four women after they consumed the elderberry extract, a relatively large peak at 520 nm was observed in the chromatogram with a retention time of 27 min (Fig. 1B). Compared with the profile of the mixed standard of six ACN (Fig. 1C), it appeared that this peak contained cyanidin-3-glucoside. The enlarged chromatogram indicated that it contained two peaks (Fig. 2A, Peaks 1 and 2). From the mass spectral data (Fig. 2B), we found one of them, which was eluted a little bit earlier than the other, has a molecular weight of 581.0 (mass-to-charge ratio, or m/z: 581.0). Its daughter fragment ion had an m/z of 287.2 from the MS/MS data (Fig. 2B). The other coeluting peak had an m/z of 449.1, with a daughter fragment peak with an m/z of 287.2. Comparing their elution times, spectra, and data from the previous paper (17), we identified these two peaks as cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. They are the major ACN that account for 90% of the total ACN in elderberry (24) and cyanidin is the only ACN aglycone present in elderberry (25).\n\nThere were some additional small peaks with retention times of 33–36 min. Their spectra indicated that they were also ACN. Their structures were further confirmed by MS.\n\nFIGURE 1 RP-HPLC chromatograms of urine samples from subject G before (A) and 0–2 h after consuming the elderberry extract (B). Chromatogram C is of six mixed anthocyanins: delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside from left to right on the chromatogram.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS\n\n1867\n\nmAU\n\nPeak 2 uronide residue, which is a very common conjugated form of flavonoids in humans (26). This peak may be peonidin mono-glucuronide. However, we could not determine the exact site of glucuronidation on the peonidin from the available data. Subject G, 0-2 hour Two other small peaks (Peaks 8 and 9) which eluted earlier than Peak 7 were not identified because of their low concentrations. There was another glucuronide conjugated form with a retention time of 19.8 min on the subject G chromatogram (0 –2 h) (Fig. 4B, Peak 10). MS spectral results indicated an m/z of 625.3 and MS/MS data gave two fragments with an m/z of 463.1 and 287.2. (Fig. 4B). An m/z of 287.2 is typical for cyanidin aglycone, and 463.1 minus 287.2 is 176, which is indicative of a glucuronide residue. The difference between 463.1 and the m/z of the parent compound (625.3) is 162.2, which matches that of a hexose residue. Because only cyanidin-3-glucoside is present in elderberry, this peak should be the monoglucuronide form of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a compound which has four free hydroxyl groups. The exact glucuronidation site on cyanidin is not known. Two other peaks in the same chromatogram (Peaks 11 and 12) were not identified. They were not typical ACN based on their MS spectral data. Not all metabolites were detected in all subjects. A summary of the MS data and total urinary excretion is shown in Table 1.\n\nBlueberry study. Urine samples from the five women who consumed blueberry had ACN in their urine. However, the ACN concentrations were much lower than those in the women who consumed elderberry. When we tried to identify ACN with MS, we were unable to detect the ACN signal separate from the background signals. We used the blueberry.\n\nmAU\n\nPeak Peak 3 Subject G, 0-2 hour 4 Peonidin 3-glucoside Peak 5 0.8 Peonidin 3-sambubioside Peak 6\n\nIntens32 33 34 35 36 37 min\n\nx105}$ + All MS, 33.1min (#569) B\n\n102.2 301.5 421.1 468.3 595.9 151.1 232.2 361.8 549.3 629.8\n\nx10⁹ MS/MS(595), 33.2min (#570)\n\n301.2\n\n121.6 193.9 233.6 412.6 478.6 539.7 606.7 675.7 713.3\n\n463.1 + All MS, 34.4min (#591)\n\n119.3 301.0 534.3 706.5 206.3 261.4 371.3 427.3 603.9 669.0\n\n301.2 + MS/MS(463), 34.5min (#592)\n\n613.3\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 m/z\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of anthocyanins (ACN) metabolites in the urine sample from subject G (0–2 h).

The total excreted accounted for 0.004% (wt/wt) of the amount consumed. We also compared the urinary ACN excretion to ACN in the meal. The results are shown in Figure 5. The relative proportions of the different ACN were similar except for the arabinose forms of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin. We did not detect any ACN peaks in plasma at 520 nm from 2 mL of sample in any of the subjects.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nIdentification and excretion (0 – 4 h) of anthocyanins in the urine of elderly women consuming elderberry extract\n\nCompound MS (m/z) MS/MS (m/z) Subject B (mg/4 h) Subject G (mg/4 h) Subject J (mg/4 h) Subject R (mg/4 h) Cyanidin–3-sambubioside 581.2 287.2 417.12 498.21 388.70 360.022 Cyanidin–3-glucoside 449.1 287.2 Peonidin–3-glucoside 463.3 301.2 64.22 66.98 26.00 31.62 Peonidin–3-sambubioside 595.9 301.2 ND 29.53 ND ND Peonidin monoglucuronide 477.1 301.2 142.25 ND ND 95.10 Cyanidin–3-glucoside monoglucuronide 625.3 463.1/287.2 ND 40.27 50.77 ND Total (mg) 627.89 634.99 465.47 486.74 Mean ± SD (mg) 553.77 ± 90.15 Total excretion (% intake) 0.087 0.088 0.065 0.068 Mean ± SD (% intake) 0.077 ± 0.013\n\n1 Quantities calculated based upon either cyanidin- or peonidin-3-glucoside standards.\n\n2 Cyanidin–3-sambubioside and cyanidin–3-glucoside appeared as one peak; the values of this line include both of them and calculated as cyanidin–3-glucoside equivalent.\n\n3 Not detected.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS lower detection limit under our current conditions would be 0.005 mg/L (based on cyanidin-3-glucoside).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nACN have been considered to not be absorbed in the human body, unless they were first hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the gastrointestinal tract. The poor lipophilic properties of ACN have led to the conviction that they are underabsorbed. Horwitt (11) was perhaps the first to observe the ACN pigments in the urine of rabbits. Recently, however, several investigators have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in both human and animal bodies as intact forms (12–23). Some investigators have shown that quercetin glucosides may interact with the intestinal glucose transporter and be absorbed in that manner (28–30). Whether ACN could be absorbed by a similar mechanism remains unknown. Müller et al. (22) compared the urinary excretion when elderberry ACN were consumed with and without simultaneous ingestion of sugar. The total excretion of ACN with sugar was lower than that without sugar, indicating that sugar carriers might play a role in flavonoid absorption. The presence of the sambubioside form gives strong credence to this as it is unlikely that the sambubioside form could be reformed from the aglycone after its absorption.\n\nPrevious studies have also indicated that methylation is an established pathway in the metabolism of flavonoids (26). For several flavonoids with 3, 4-dihydroxylation of ring B, conjugates of their 3-O-methyl ethers were excreted (31–32). This transformation occurred in the liver and was catalyzed by catechol-O-methyl transferase (14,33). Cyanidin is an anthocyanidin with a 3, 4-dihydroxylation pattern of ring B. We detected peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in the urine from humans. Miyazawa et al. (15) found a methylated form of an ACN in liver of rats and the concentration of the methylated form was much higher than the original form in the liver, but they did not detect it in plasma and urine. They (15) assumed that these methylated compounds were excreted from the liver into bile directly. However, we detected the methylated form of ACN in the urine of humans. Thus, they must appear in the blood and be excreted by the kidney.\n\nConjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are considered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds. They are also the common final steps in the metabolic pathway of flavonoids in mammalian systems (26,34). These modifications could start in the small intestine, liver, or kidney (35–36). UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and sulfotransferase in the liver would likely be responsible for this conjugation (26,37). So far, many different subclasses of flavonoids have been found to be absorbed and excreted as glucuronide forms in both humans and experimental animals (26,35,37,38). But for ACN, no glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms have been found in urine or plasma of either humans or experimental animals. This observation is completely different from other flavonoids, such as catechin and epicatechin, or isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein, whose basic structures are similar to ACN. Miyazawa et al. (15) assumed that the flavylium cation structure of ACN may impart resistance to such enzymatic conversion into conjugates.\n\nIn our studies we detected the glucuronide conjugate forms for the first time. These results indicate that ACN might share some of the same metabolic pathways with other flavonoid compounds. Perhaps, others did not detect them because of the low concentrations of these metabolites. We detected and tentatively identified them using diode–array detector and MS. We were unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with the enzyme β-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min). Hydrolysis of the conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in that ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared completely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h. Because previous investigators have relied on detecting the conjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations before and after incubation with β-glucuronidase, small amounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any conjugates that were present.\n\nIn this study, we still do not know how the peonidin monoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could describe the formation of this metabolite (Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-glucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to form peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).\n\nEither cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could serve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form the corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this to occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would have to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique enzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-glucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination (39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine of the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis would explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This pathway seems likely since we have found all of these compounds in urine.\n\nA second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and absorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and conjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cyanidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid (14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of humans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat jejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to find peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we have not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is that we are generally working near the limits of detection of\n\nOMe\n\nOH HO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nCyanidin aglycone Peonidin aglycone\n\nOH OMe OH\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside + CH,OH Peonidin monoglucuronide\n\nOH Pathway 2\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside monoglucuronide Peonidin 3-glucoside\n\nOMe\n\nCOOH\n\nOH\n\nPeonidin 3-glucuronide\n\nPathway 1\n\nFIGURE 6 Glucuronide conjugated forms from cyanidin-3-glucoside.

It is clear from all but one of these studies that the recovery of ACN or ACN metabolites in urine is quite low (0.004 – 0.11% of dose). The one study in which urinary excretion was much higher (13) involved subjects who consumed wine and the “ACN-like” compounds which absorbed at 520 nm and were not well characterized. It may be that ACN in wine are absorbed to a much greater extent than from berries or berry juices or extracts.\n\nIn summary, we observed for the first time the presence of glucuronide forms of ACN, namely peonidin monoglucuronide and cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide, in the urine of humans after the consumption of elderberry ACN. We observed the apparent methylation of both cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside to peonidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-sambubioside. We were unable to detect ACN in plasma from women who consumed a single meal of blueberries; however, they were detectable in the urine but the quantities were quite low, with the total amount excreted during the first 6 h being only 0.004% of the quantity consumed.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nMazza, G. & Miniati, E.

What is Blueberry study about?,"['Human Nutrition and Metabolism\n\nAbsorption and Metabolism of Anthocyanins in Elderly Women after Consumption of Elderberry or Blueberry\n\nXianli Wu,* Guohua Cao† and Ronald L. Prior1,3\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center, Little Rock, AR 72202 and †U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts, Boston 02111\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB) (690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 ± 90 mg (mean ± SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 ± 10.9 mg (mean ± SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.

Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.\n\nKEY WORDS:\n\nanthocyanin\n\nmetabolite\n\nelderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n\nblueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\n\nAnthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread group of plant constituents known collectively as flavonoids. They are mainly distributed among flowers, fruits and vegetables and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in flower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited because of their poor stability. As a potential major component of our daily diet (4), more and more research has concentrated on their biological activities and possible health benefits in protecting against some chronic diseases, including cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Some of these biological activities and protective functions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities (5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal chelation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\n\nTo evaluate the health benefits of ACN in humans, the bioavailability including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider the metabolites (such as ring-fission products produced by microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.) instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the concentration of the original forms in human body is much less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contribute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However, information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited. As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides, were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body unless they were hydrolyzed by intestinal microorganisms. Recently, several papers on the absorption and metabolism of dietary ACN have shown that ACN can be absorbed in experimental animals and humans as glycosides (12–23). We have previously detected the intact glycoside forms in blood and urine of humans after consuming elderberry ACN (16–17). Murkovic and coworkers (20–22) studied the absorption and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that ACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood and urine as intact glycosides. This report documents that additional ACN metabolites are present in humans after consumption of ACN from an elderberry extract or whole blueberry.\n\n0022-3166/02 $3.00 © 2002 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

The 3-O-β-glucoside of pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin (six mixed ACN standard, HPLC grade), and cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (HPLC grade) were obtained from Polyphenols Laboratories (Sandnes, Norway); methanol from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ); formic acid from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and β-glucuronidase from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO); Sep-Pak Vac RC (500 mg) C₁₈ Cartridges for solid-phase extraction (SPE) were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA).\n\nSubjects and study design. The study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee of Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, and written, informed consent was obtained from each study participant.\n\nFor the elderberry study, four healthy women, 60–70 y old, consumed 12 g elderberry extract that contained a total of 720 mg of ACN blended in 500 mL water after fasting overnight as described previously (17). Urine samples were collected from these subjects before the consumption of elderberry extract and between 0 and 2, 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12, and 12 and 24 h after consumption of the elderberry extract. The urine samples were treated with 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2, v/v) and then stored at -70°C before analysis.\n\nFor the blueberry study, six healthy elderly women, 60–70 y old, were given 189 g frozen lowbush blueberry (BB) (containing a total of 690 mg of ACN) blended in 315 mL water after fasting overnight. The urine samples were collected and treated as described above. Blood samples were collected before and at 10, 20, 30, 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after consumption of blueberry. The blood samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then plasma samples were quickly removed and immediately treated with an aqueous solution of 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2; v/v). These samples were stored in -70°C until analysis.\n\nSample preparation.\n\nThe urine samples were treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as follows. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL methanol, and then equilibrated with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. Urine samples (5 mL) were loaded onto the cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. ACN were recovered with 5 mL 5% formic acid/methanol solution. The methanol solution was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY) and redissolved in 200 μL 5% formic acid methanol solution. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for analysis of ACN.\n\nBlood samples were also treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as previously described (16). After SPE treatment, water-soluble compounds, polar lipids, and neutral lipids were removed from the plasma samples. ACN were eluted finally with 5 mL of 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. The methanol phase was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant) and redissolved in 200 μL 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for the analysis of ACN.\n\nBefore experimental samples were prepared, blank urine and blood samples spiked with cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside were prepared using the same procedures to test the recovery of the sample preparation method.\n\nAnalysis of ACN in urine and plasma.\n\nThe analysis of ACN in urine was carried out on an HP series 1100 HPLC system including an autosampler, a binary pump, Zorbax SB-C₁₈ column (4.6 × 250 mm), and a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Elution was performed using mobile phase A (5% formic acid aqueous solution) and mobile phase B (pure methanol). The flow rate was 1 mL/min and detection was at 520 nm. The gradient system used was as follows: 0–2 min, 5% B; 2–10 min, 5–20% B; 10–15 min, 20% B; 15–30 min, 20–30% B; 30–35 min, 30% B; 35–50 min, 30–45% B; 50–55 min, 45% B; 55–65 min, 45–5% B; and 65–68 min, 5% B.\n\nLow-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with an Esquire-LC Mass Spectrometer (MS) (Bruker Daltoniks, Billerica, MA), an ion trap instrument equipped with an electrospray interface. Column effluent was monitored in positive mode of the MS. Major MS parameters were: capillary exit, 3500 V; capillary offset, 500 V.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRecovery tests.\n\nResults of recovery tests on SPE of cyanidin-3-glucoside from urine was 90.0 ± 1.5% (n = 3); the recovery of cyanidin-3-glucoside on SPE from plasma was 91.4 ± 0.9% (n = 3).\n\nElderberry study.\n\nNo ACN peaks were detected in urine samples collected before consumption of the elderberry extract (Fig. 1A). In all samples collected from the four women after they consumed the elderberry extract, a relatively large peak at 520 nm was observed in the chromatogram with a retention time of 27 min (Fig. 1B). Compared with the profile of the mixed standard of six ACN (Fig. 1C), it appeared that this peak contained cyanidin-3-glucoside. The enlarged chromatogram indicated that it contained two peaks (Fig. 2A, Peaks 1 and 2). From the mass spectral data (Fig. 2B), we found one of them, which was eluted a little bit earlier than the other, has a molecular weight of 581.0 (mass-to-charge ratio, or m/z: 581.0). Its daughter fragment ion had an m/z of 287.2 from the MS/MS data (Fig. 2B). The other coeluting peak had an m/z of 449.1, with a daughter fragment peak with an m/z of 287.2. Comparing their elution times, spectra, and data from the previous paper (17), we identified these two peaks as cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. They are the major ACN that account for 90% of the total ACN in elderberry (24) and cyanidin is the only ACN aglycone present in elderberry (25).\n\nThere were some additional small peaks with retention times of 33–36 min. Their spectra indicated that they were also ACN. Their structures were further confirmed by MS.\n\nFIGURE 1 RP-HPLC chromatograms of urine samples from subject G before (A) and 0–2 h after consuming the elderberry extract (B). Chromatogram C is of six mixed anthocyanins: delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside from left to right on the chromatogram.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS\n\n1867\n\nmAU\n\nPeak 2 uronide residue, which is a very common conjugated form of flavonoids in humans (26). This peak may be peonidin mono-glucuronide. However, we could not determine the exact site of glucuronidation on the peonidin from the available data. Subject G, 0-2 hour Two other small peaks (Peaks 8 and 9) which eluted earlier than Peak 7 were not identified because of their low concentrations. There was another glucuronide conjugated form with a retention time of 19.8 min on the subject G chromatogram (0 –2 h) (Fig. 4B, Peak 10). MS spectral results indicated an m/z of 625.3 and MS/MS data gave two fragments with an m/z of 463.1 and 287.2. (Fig. 4B). An m/z of 287.2 is typical for cyanidin aglycone, and 463.1 minus 287.2 is 176, which is indicative of a glucuronide residue. The difference between 463.1 and the m/z of the parent compound (625.3) is 162.2, which matches that of a hexose residue. Because only cyanidin-3-glucoside is present in elderberry, this peak should be the monoglucuronide form of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a compound which has four free hydroxyl groups. The exact glucuronidation site on cyanidin is not known. Two other peaks in the same chromatogram (Peaks 11 and 12) were not identified. They were not typical ACN based on their MS spectral data. Not all metabolites were detected in all subjects. A summary of the MS data and total urinary excretion is shown in Table 1.\n\nBlueberry study. Urine samples from the five women who consumed blueberry had ACN in their urine. However, the ACN concentrations were much lower than those in the women who consumed elderberry. When we tried to identify ACN with MS, we were unable to detect the ACN signal separate from the background signals. We used the blueberry.\n\nmAU\n\nPeak Peak 3 Subject G, 0-2 hour 4 Peonidin 3-glucoside Peak 5 0.8 Peonidin 3-sambubioside Peak 6\n\nIntens32 33 34 35 36 37 min\n\nx105}$ + All MS, 33.1min (#569) B\n\n102.2 301.5 421.1 468.3 595.9 151.1 232.2 361.8 549.3 629.8\n\nx10⁹ MS/MS(595), 33.2min (#570)\n\n301.2\n\n121.6 193.9 233.6 412.6 478.6 539.7 606.7 675.7 713.3\n\n463.1 + All MS, 34.4min (#591)\n\n119.3 301.0 534.3 706.5 206.3 261.4 371.3 427.3 603.9 669.0\n\n301.2 + MS/MS(463), 34.5min (#592)\n\n613.3\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 m/z\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of anthocyanins (ACN) metabolites in the urine sample from subject G (0–2 h).

By means of HPLC-MS/MS and comparing with previous studies, we identified 22 ACN in the blueberry food sample. We found several ACN in urine samples when comparing to the blueberry sample. Total urinary excretions were 7.62 ± 5.00, 10.07 ± 3.28, 5.56 ± 5.07, and 23.25 ± 10.88 mg for 0 –2 h, 2– 4h, 4 – 6 h, and 0 – 6 h, respectively (n = 5). The total excreted accounted for 0.004% (wt/wt) of the amount consumed. We also compared the urinary ACN excretion to ACN in the meal. The results are shown in Figure 5. The relative proportions of the different ACN were similar except for the arabinose forms of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin. We did not detect any ACN peaks in plasma at 520 nm from 2 mL of sample in any of the subjects.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nIdentification and excretion (0 – 4 h) of anthocyanins in the urine of elderly women consuming elderberry extract\n\nCompound MS (m/z) MS/MS (m/z) Subject B (mg/4 h) Subject G (mg/4 h) Subject J (mg/4 h) Subject R (mg/4 h) Cyanidin–3-sambubioside 581.2 287.2 417.12 498.21 388.70 360.022 Cyanidin–3-glucoside 449.1 287.2 Peonidin–3-glucoside 463.3 301.2 64.22 66.98 26.00 31.62 Peonidin–3-sambubioside 595.9 301.2 ND 29.53 ND ND Peonidin monoglucuronide 477.1 301.2 142.25 ND ND 95.10 Cyanidin–3-glucoside monoglucuronide 625.3 463.1/287.2 ND 40.27 50.77 ND Total (mg) 627.89 634.99 465.47 486.74 Mean ± SD (mg) 553.77 ± 90.15 Total excretion (% intake) 0.087 0.088 0.065 0.068 Mean ± SD (% intake) 0.077 ± 0.013\n\n1 Quantities calculated based upon either cyanidin- or peonidin-3-glucoside standards.\n\n2 Cyanidin–3-sambubioside and cyanidin–3-glucoside appeared as one peak; the values of this line include both of them and calculated as cyanidin–3-glucoside equivalent.\n\n3 Not detected.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS lower detection limit under our current conditions would be 0.005 mg/L (based on cyanidin-3-glucoside).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nACN have been considered to not be absorbed in the human body, unless they were first hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the gastrointestinal tract. The poor lipophilic properties of ACN have led to the conviction that they are underabsorbed. Horwitt (11) was perhaps the first to observe the ACN pigments in the urine of rabbits. Recently, however, several investigators have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in both human and animal bodies as intact forms (12–23). Some investigators have shown that quercetin glucosides may interact with the intestinal glucose transporter and be absorbed in that manner (28–30). Whether ACN could be absorbed by a similar mechanism remains unknown. Müller et al. (22) compared the urinary excretion when elderberry ACN were consumed with and without simultaneous ingestion of sugar. The total excretion of ACN with sugar was lower than that without sugar, indicating that sugar carriers might play a role in flavonoid absorption. The presence of the sambubioside form gives strong credence to this as it is unlikely that the sambubioside form could be reformed from the aglycone after its absorption.\n\nPrevious studies have also indicated that methylation is an established pathway in the metabolism of flavonoids (26). For several flavonoids with 3, 4-dihydroxylation of ring B, conjugates of their 3-O-methyl ethers were excreted (31–32). This transformation occurred in the liver and was catalyzed by catechol-O-methyl transferase (14,33). Cyanidin is an anthocyanidin with a 3, 4-dihydroxylation pattern of ring B. We detected peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in the urine from humans. Miyazawa et al. (15) found a methylated form of an ACN in liver of rats and the concentration of the methylated form was much higher than the original form in the liver, but they did not detect it in plasma and urine. They (15) assumed that these methylated compounds were excreted from the liver into bile directly. However, we detected the methylated form of ACN in the urine of humans. Thus, they must appear in the blood and be excreted by the kidney.\n\nConjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are considered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds. They are also the common final steps in the metabolic pathway of flavonoids in mammalian systems (26,34). These modifications could start in the small intestine, liver, or kidney (35–36). UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and sulfotransferase in the liver would likely be responsible for this conjugation (26,37). So far, many different subclasses of flavonoids have been found to be absorbed and excreted as glucuronide forms in both humans and experimental animals (26,35,37,38). But for ACN, no glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms have been found in urine or plasma of either humans or experimental animals. This observation is completely different from other flavonoids, such as catechin and epicatechin, or isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein, whose basic structures are similar to ACN. Miyazawa et al. (15) assumed that the flavylium cation structure of ACN may impart resistance to such enzymatic conversion into conjugates.\n\nIn our studies we detected the glucuronide conjugate forms for the first time. These results indicate that ACN might share some of the same metabolic pathways with other flavonoid compounds. Perhaps, others did not detect them because of the low concentrations of these metabolites. We detected and tentatively identified them using diode–array detector and MS. We were unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with the enzyme β-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min). Hydrolysis of the conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in that ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared completely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h. Because previous investigators have relied on detecting the conjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations before and after incubation with β-glucuronidase, small amounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any conjugates that were present.\n\nIn this study, we still do not know how the peonidin monoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could describe the formation of this metabolite (Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-glucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to form peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).\n\nEither cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could serve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form the corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this to occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would have to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique enzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-glucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination (39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine of the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis would explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This pathway seems likely since we have found all of these compounds in urine.\n\nA second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and absorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and conjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cyanidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid (14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of humans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat jejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to find peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we have not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is that we are generally working near the limits of detection of\n\nOMe\n\nOH HO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nCyanidin aglycone Peonidin aglycone\n\nOH OMe OH\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside + CH,OH Peonidin monoglucuronide\n\nOH Pathway 2\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside monoglucuronide Peonidin 3-glucoside\n\nOMe\n\nCOOH\n\nOH\n\nPeonidin 3-glucuronide\n\nPathway 1\n\nFIGURE 6 Glucuronide conjugated forms from cyanidin-3-glucoside.

It is clear from all but one of these studies that the recovery of ACN or ACN metabolites in urine is quite low (0.004 – 0.11% of dose). The one study in which urinary excretion was much higher (13) involved subjects who consumed wine and the “ACN-like” compounds which absorbed at 520 nm and were not well characterized. It may be that ACN in wine are absorbed to a much greater extent than from berries or berry juices or extracts.\n\nIn summary, we observed for the first time the presence of glucuronide forms of ACN, namely peonidin monoglucuronide and cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide, in the urine of humans after the consumption of elderberry ACN. We observed the apparent methylation of both cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside to peonidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-sambubioside. We were unable to detect ACN in plasma from women who consumed a single meal of blueberries; however, they were detectable in the urine but the quantities were quite low, with the total amount excreted during the first 6 h being only 0.004% of the quantity consumed.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nMazza, G. & Miniati, E.

Wht is the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins in elderly women after consuming elderberry or blueberry?,"['Human Nutrition and Metabolism\n\nAbsorption and Metabolism of Anthocyanins in Elderly Women after Consumption of Elderberry or Blueberry\n\nXianli Wu,* Guohua Cao† and Ronald L. Prior1,3\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center, Little Rock, AR 72202 and †U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts, Boston 02111\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB) (690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 ± 90 mg (mean ± SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 ± 10.9 mg (mean ± SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.

They are mainly distributed among flowers, fruits and vegetables and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in flower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited because of their poor stability. As a potential major component of our daily diet (4), more and more research has concentrated on their biological activities and possible health benefits in protecting against some chronic diseases, including cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Some of these biological activities and protective functions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities (5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal chelation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\n\nTo evaluate the health benefits of ACN in humans, the bioavailability including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider the metabolites (such as ring-fission products produced by microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.) instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the concentration of the original forms in human body is much less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contribute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However, information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited. As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides, were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body unless they were hydrolyzed by intestinal microorganisms. Recently, several papers on the absorption and metabolism of dietary ACN have shown that ACN can be absorbed in experimental animals and humans as glycosides (12–23). We have previously detected the intact glycoside forms in blood and urine of humans after consuming elderberry ACN (16–17). Murkovic and coworkers (20–22) studied the absorption and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that ACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood and urine as intact glycosides. This report documents that additional ACN metabolites are present in humans after consumption of ACN from an elderberry extract or whole blueberry.\n\n0022-3166/02 $3.00 © 2002 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

The 3-O-β-glucoside of pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin (six mixed ACN standard, HPLC grade), and cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (HPLC grade) were obtained from Polyphenols Laboratories (Sandnes, Norway); methanol from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ); formic acid from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and β-glucuronidase from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO); Sep-Pak Vac RC (500 mg) C₁₈ Cartridges for solid-phase extraction (SPE) were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA).\n\nSubjects and study design. The study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee of Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, and written, informed consent was obtained from each study participant.\n\nFor the elderberry study, four healthy women, 60–70 y old, consumed 12 g elderberry extract that contained a total of 720 mg of ACN blended in 500 mL water after fasting overnight as described previously (17). Urine samples were collected from these subjects before the consumption of elderberry extract and between 0 and 2, 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12, and 12 and 24 h after consumption of the elderberry extract. The urine samples were treated with 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2, v/v) and then stored at -70°C before analysis.\n\nFor the blueberry study, six healthy elderly women, 60–70 y old, were given 189 g frozen lowbush blueberry (BB) (containing a total of 690 mg of ACN) blended in 315 mL water after fasting overnight. The urine samples were collected and treated as described above. Blood samples were collected before and at 10, 20, 30, 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after consumption of blueberry. The blood samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then plasma samples were quickly removed and immediately treated with an aqueous solution of 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2; v/v). These samples were stored in -70°C until analysis.\n\nSample preparation.\n\nThe urine samples were treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as follows. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL methanol, and then equilibrated with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. Urine samples (5 mL) were loaded onto the cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. ACN were recovered with 5 mL 5% formic acid/methanol solution. The methanol solution was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY) and redissolved in 200 μL 5% formic acid methanol solution. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for analysis of ACN.\n\nBlood samples were also treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as previously described (16). After SPE treatment, water-soluble compounds, polar lipids, and neutral lipids were removed from the plasma samples. ACN were eluted finally with 5 mL of 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. The methanol phase was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant) and redissolved in 200 μL 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for the analysis of ACN.\n\nBefore experimental samples were prepared, blank urine and blood samples spiked with cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside were prepared using the same procedures to test the recovery of the sample preparation method.\n\nAnalysis of ACN in urine and plasma.\n\nThe analysis of ACN in urine was carried out on an HP series 1100 HPLC system including an autosampler, a binary pump, Zorbax SB-C₁₈ column (4.6 × 250 mm), and a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Elution was performed using mobile phase A (5% formic acid aqueous solution) and mobile phase B (pure methanol). The flow rate was 1 mL/min and detection was at 520 nm. The gradient system used was as follows: 0–2 min, 5% B; 2–10 min, 5–20% B; 10–15 min, 20% B; 15–30 min, 20–30% B; 30–35 min, 30% B; 35–50 min, 30–45% B; 50–55 min, 45% B; 55–65 min, 45–5% B; and 65–68 min, 5% B.\n\nLow-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with an Esquire-LC Mass Spectrometer (MS) (Bruker Daltoniks, Billerica, MA), an ion trap instrument equipped with an electrospray interface. Column effluent was monitored in positive mode of the MS. Major MS parameters were: capillary exit, 3500 V; capillary offset, 500 V.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRecovery tests.\n\nResults of recovery tests on SPE of cyanidin-3-glucoside from urine was 90.0 ± 1.5% (n = 3); the recovery of cyanidin-3-glucoside on SPE from plasma was 91.4 ± 0.9% (n = 3).\n\nElderberry study.\n\nNo ACN peaks were detected in urine samples collected before consumption of the elderberry extract (Fig. 1A). In all samples collected from the four women after they consumed the elderberry extract, a relatively large peak at 520 nm was observed in the chromatogram with a retention time of 27 min (Fig. 1B). Compared with the profile of the mixed standard of six ACN (Fig. 1C), it appeared that this peak contained cyanidin-3-glucoside. The enlarged chromatogram indicated that it contained two peaks (Fig. 2A, Peaks 1 and 2). From the mass spectral data (Fig. 2B), we found one of them, which was eluted a little bit earlier than the other, has a molecular weight of 581.0 (mass-to-charge ratio, or m/z: 581.0). Its daughter fragment ion had an m/z of 287.2 from the MS/MS data (Fig. 2B). The other coeluting peak had an m/z of 449.1, with a daughter fragment peak with an m/z of 287.2. Comparing their elution times, spectra, and data from the previous paper (17), we identified these two peaks as cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. They are the major ACN that account for 90% of the total ACN in elderberry (24) and cyanidin is the only ACN aglycone present in elderberry (25).\n\nThere were some additional small peaks with retention times of 33–36 min. Their spectra indicated that they were also ACN. Their structures were further confirmed by MS.\n\nFIGURE 1 RP-HPLC chromatograms of urine samples from subject G before (A) and 0–2 h after consuming the elderberry extract (B). Chromatogram C is of six mixed anthocyanins: delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside from left to right on the chromatogram.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS\n\n1867\n\nmAU\n\nPeak 2 uronide residue, which is a very common conjugated form of flavonoids in humans (26). This peak may be peonidin mono-glucuronide. However, we could not determine the exact site of glucuronidation on the peonidin from the available data. Subject G, 0-2 hour Two other small peaks (Peaks 8 and 9) which eluted earlier than Peak 7 were not identified because of their low concentrations. There was another glucuronide conjugated form with a retention time of 19.8 min on the subject G chromatogram (0 –2 h) (Fig. 4B, Peak 10). MS spectral results indicated an m/z of 625.3 and MS/MS data gave two fragments with an m/z of 463.1 and 287.2. (Fig. 4B). An m/z of 287.2 is typical for cyanidin aglycone, and 463.1 minus 287.2 is 176, which is indicative of a glucuronide residue. The difference between 463.1 and the m/z of the parent compound (625.3) is 162.2, which matches that of a hexose residue. Because only cyanidin-3-glucoside is present in elderberry, this peak should be the monoglucuronide form of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a compound which has four free hydroxyl groups. The exact glucuronidation site on cyanidin is not known. Two other peaks in the same chromatogram (Peaks 11 and 12) were not identified. They were not typical ACN based on their MS spectral data. Not all metabolites were detected in all subjects. A summary of the MS data and total urinary excretion is shown in Table 1.\n\nBlueberry study. Urine samples from the five women who consumed blueberry had ACN in their urine. However, the ACN concentrations were much lower than those in the women who consumed elderberry. When we tried to identify ACN with MS, we were unable to detect the ACN signal separate from the background signals. We used the blueberry.\n\nmAU\n\nPeak Peak 3 Subject G, 0-2 hour 4 Peonidin 3-glucoside Peak 5 0.8 Peonidin 3-sambubioside Peak 6\n\nIntens32 33 34 35 36 37 min\n\nx105}$ + All MS, 33.1min (#569) B\n\n102.2 301.5 421.1 468.3 595.9 151.1 232.2 361.8 549.3 629.8\n\nx10⁹ MS/MS(595), 33.2min (#570)\n\n301.2\n\n121.6 193.9 233.6 412.6 478.6 539.7 606.7 675.7 713.3\n\n463.1 + All MS, 34.4min (#591)\n\n119.3 301.0 534.3 706.5 206.3 261.4 371.3 427.3 603.9 669.0\n\n301.2 + MS/MS(463), 34.5min (#592)\n\n613.3\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 m/z\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of anthocyanins (ACN) metabolites in the urine sample from subject G (0–2 h).

By means of HPLC-MS/MS and comparing with previous studies, we identified 22 ACN in the blueberry food sample. We found several ACN in urine samples when comparing to the blueberry sample. Total urinary excretions were 7.62 ± 5.00, 10.07 ± 3.28, 5.56 ± 5.07, and 23.25 ± 10.88 mg for 0 –2 h, 2– 4h, 4 – 6 h, and 0 – 6 h, respectively (n = 5). The total excreted accounted for 0.004% (wt/wt) of the amount consumed. We also compared the urinary ACN excretion to ACN in the meal. The results are shown in Figure 5. The relative proportions of the different ACN were similar except for the arabinose forms of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin. We did not detect any ACN peaks in plasma at 520 nm from 2 mL of sample in any of the subjects.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nIdentification and excretion (0 – 4 h) of anthocyanins in the urine of elderly women consuming elderberry extract\n\nCompound MS (m/z) MS/MS (m/z) Subject B (mg/4 h) Subject G (mg/4 h) Subject J (mg/4 h) Subject R (mg/4 h) Cyanidin–3-sambubioside 581.2 287.2 417.12 498.21 388.70 360.022 Cyanidin–3-glucoside 449.1 287.2 Peonidin–3-glucoside 463.3 301.2 64.22 66.98 26.00 31.62 Peonidin–3-sambubioside 595.9 301.2 ND 29.53 ND ND Peonidin monoglucuronide 477.1 301.2 142.25 ND ND 95.10 Cyanidin–3-glucoside monoglucuronide 625.3 463.1/287.2 ND 40.27 50.77 ND Total (mg) 627.89 634.99 465.47 486.74 Mean ± SD (mg) 553.77 ± 90.15 Total excretion (% intake) 0.087 0.088 0.065 0.068 Mean ± SD (% intake) 0.077 ± 0.013\n\n1 Quantities calculated based upon either cyanidin- or peonidin-3-glucoside standards.\n\n2 Cyanidin–3-sambubioside and cyanidin–3-glucoside appeared as one peak; the values of this line include both of them and calculated as cyanidin–3-glucoside equivalent.\n\n3 Not detected.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS lower detection limit under our current conditions would be 0.005 mg/L (based on cyanidin-3-glucoside).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nACN have been considered to not be absorbed in the human body, unless they were first hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the gastrointestinal tract. The poor lipophilic properties of ACN have led to the conviction that they are underabsorbed. Horwitt (11) was perhaps the first to observe the ACN pigments in the urine of rabbits. Recently, however, several investigators have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in both human and animal bodies as intact forms (12–23). Some investigators have shown that quercetin glucosides may interact with the intestinal glucose transporter and be absorbed in that manner (28–30). Whether ACN could be absorbed by a similar mechanism remains unknown. Müller et al. (22) compared the urinary excretion when elderberry ACN were consumed with and without simultaneous ingestion of sugar. The total excretion of ACN with sugar was lower than that without sugar, indicating that sugar carriers might play a role in flavonoid absorption. The presence of the sambubioside form gives strong credence to this as it is unlikely that the sambubioside form could be reformed from the aglycone after its absorption.\n\nPrevious studies have also indicated that methylation is an established pathway in the metabolism of flavonoids (26). For several flavonoids with 3, 4-dihydroxylation of ring B, conjugates of their 3-O-methyl ethers were excreted (31–32). This transformation occurred in the liver and was catalyzed by catechol-O-methyl transferase (14,33). Cyanidin is an anthocyanidin with a 3, 4-dihydroxylation pattern of ring B. We detected peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in the urine from humans. Miyazawa et al. (15) found a methylated form of an ACN in liver of rats and the concentration of the methylated form was much higher than the original form in the liver, but they did not detect it in plasma and urine. They (15) assumed that these methylated compounds were excreted from the liver into bile directly. However, we detected the methylated form of ACN in the urine of humans. Thus, they must appear in the blood and be excreted by the kidney.\n\nConjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are considered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds. They are also the common final steps in the metabolic pathway of flavonoids in mammalian systems (26,34). These modifications could start in the small intestine, liver, or kidney (35–36). UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and sulfotransferase in the liver would likely be responsible for this conjugation (26,37). So far, many different subclasses of flavonoids have been found to be absorbed and excreted as glucuronide forms in both humans and experimental animals (26,35,37,38). But for ACN, no glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms have been found in urine or plasma of either humans or experimental animals. This observation is completely different from other flavonoids, such as catechin and epicatechin, or isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein, whose basic structures are similar to ACN. Miyazawa et al. (15) assumed that the flavylium cation structure of ACN may impart resistance to such enzymatic conversion into conjugates.\n\nIn our studies we detected the glucuronide conjugate forms for the first time. These results indicate that ACN might share some of the same metabolic pathways with other flavonoid compounds. Perhaps, others did not detect them because of the low concentrations of these metabolites. We detected and tentatively identified them using diode–array detector and MS. We were unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with the enzyme β-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min). Hydrolysis of the conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in that ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared completely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h. Because previous investigators have relied on detecting the conjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations before and after incubation with β-glucuronidase, small amounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any conjugates that were present.\n\nIn this study, we still do not know how the peonidin monoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could describe the formation of this metabolite (Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-glucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to form peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).\n\nEither cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could serve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form the corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this to occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would have to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique enzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-glucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination (39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine of the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis would explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This pathway seems likely since we have found all of these compounds in urine.\n\nA second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and absorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and conjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cyanidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid (14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of humans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat jejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to find peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we have not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is that we are generally working near the limits of detection of\n\nOMe\n\nOH HO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nCyanidin aglycone Peonidin aglycone\n\nOH OMe OH\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside + CH,OH Peonidin monoglucuronide\n\nOH Pathway 2\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside monoglucuronide Peonidin 3-glucoside\n\nOMe\n\nCOOH\n\nOH\n\nPeonidin 3-glucuronide\n\nPathway 1\n\nFIGURE 6 Glucuronide conjugated forms from cyanidin-3-glucoside.

It is clear from all but one of these studies that the recovery of ACN or ACN metabolites in urine is quite low (0.004 – 0.11% of dose). The one study in which urinary excretion was much higher (13) involved subjects who consumed wine and the “ACN-like” compounds which absorbed at 520 nm and were not well characterized. It may be that ACN in wine are absorbed to a much greater extent than from berries or berry juices or extracts.\n\nIn summary, we observed for the first time the presence of glucuronide forms of ACN, namely peonidin monoglucuronide and cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide, in the urine of humans after the consumption of elderberry ACN. We observed the apparent methylation of both cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside to peonidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-sambubioside. We were unable to detect ACN in plasma from women who consumed a single meal of blueberries; however, they were detectable in the urine but the quantities were quite low, with the total amount excreted during the first 6 h being only 0.004% of the quantity consumed.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nMazza, G. & Miniati, E.

The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 ± 90 mg (mean ± SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 ± 10.9 mg (mean ± SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.

They are mainly distributed among flowers, fruits and vegetables and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in flower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited because of their poor stability. As a potential major component of our daily diet (4), more and more research has concentrated on their biological activities and possible health benefits in protecting against some chronic diseases, including cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Some of these biological activities and protective functions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities (5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal chelation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\n\nTo evaluate the health benefits of ACN in humans, the bioavailability including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider the metabolites (such as ring-fission products produced by microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.) instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the concentration of the original forms in human body is much less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contribute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However, information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited. As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides, were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body unless they were hydrolyzed by intestinal microorganisms. Recently, several papers on the absorption and metabolism of dietary ACN have shown that ACN can be absorbed in experimental animals and humans as glycosides (12–23). We have previously detected the intact glycoside forms in blood and urine of humans after consuming elderberry ACN (16–17). Murkovic and coworkers (20–22) studied the absorption and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that ACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood and urine as intact glycosides. This report documents that additional ACN metabolites are present in humans after consumption of ACN from an elderberry extract or whole blueberry.\n\n0022-3166/02 $3.00 © 2002 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

The 3-O-β-glucoside of pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin (six mixed ACN standard, HPLC grade), and cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (HPLC grade) were obtained from Polyphenols Laboratories (Sandnes, Norway); methanol from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ); formic acid from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and β-glucuronidase from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO); Sep-Pak Vac RC (500 mg) C₁₈ Cartridges for solid-phase extraction (SPE) were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA).\n\nSubjects and study design. The study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee of Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, and written, informed consent was obtained from each study participant.\n\nFor the elderberry study, four healthy women, 60–70 y old, consumed 12 g elderberry extract that contained a total of 720 mg of ACN blended in 500 mL water after fasting overnight as described previously (17). Urine samples were collected from these subjects before the consumption of elderberry extract and between 0 and 2, 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12, and 12 and 24 h after consumption of the elderberry extract. The urine samples were treated with 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2, v/v) and then stored at -70°C before analysis.\n\nFor the blueberry study, six healthy elderly women, 60–70 y old, were given 189 g frozen lowbush blueberry (BB) (containing a total of 690 mg of ACN) blended in 315 mL water after fasting overnight. The urine samples were collected and treated as described above. Blood samples were collected before and at 10, 20, 30, 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after consumption of blueberry. The blood samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then plasma samples were quickly removed and immediately treated with an aqueous solution of 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2; v/v). These samples were stored in -70°C until analysis.\n\nSample preparation.\n\nThe urine samples were treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as follows. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL methanol, and then equilibrated with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. Urine samples (5 mL) were loaded onto the cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 5 mL 5% formic acid/aqueous solution. ACN were recovered with 5 mL 5% formic acid/methanol solution. The methanol solution was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY) and redissolved in 200 μL 5% formic acid methanol solution. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for analysis of ACN.\n\nBlood samples were also treated with the Sep-Pak C₁₈ SPE cartridge as previously described (16). After SPE treatment, water-soluble compounds, polar lipids, and neutral lipids were removed from the plasma samples. ACN were eluted finally with 5 mL of 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. The methanol phase was evaporated completely with a SpeedVac (SC210A, ThermoSavant) and redissolved in 200 μL 0.44 mol/L TFA in methanol. After filtration with a syringe filter (0.45 μm, Phenomenex), the solution was injected into the HPLC/MS system for the analysis of ACN.\n\nBefore experimental samples were prepared, blank urine and blood samples spiked with cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside were prepared using the same procedures to test the recovery of the sample preparation method.\n\nAnalysis of ACN in urine and plasma.\n\nThe analysis of ACN in urine was carried out on an HP series 1100 HPLC system including an autosampler, a binary pump, Zorbax SB-C₁₈ column (4.6 × 250 mm), and a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Elution was performed using mobile phase A (5% formic acid aqueous solution) and mobile phase B (pure methanol). The flow rate was 1 mL/min and detection was at 520 nm. The gradient system used was as follows: 0–2 min, 5% B; 2–10 min, 5–20% B; 10–15 min, 20% B; 15–30 min, 20–30% B; 30–35 min, 30% B; 35–50 min, 30–45% B; 50–55 min, 45% B; 55–65 min, 45–5% B; and 65–68 min, 5% B.\n\nLow-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with an Esquire-LC Mass Spectrometer (MS) (Bruker Daltoniks, Billerica, MA), an ion trap instrument equipped with an electrospray interface. Column effluent was monitored in positive mode of the MS. Major MS parameters were: capillary exit, 3500 V; capillary offset, 500 V.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRecovery tests.\n\nResults of recovery tests on SPE of cyanidin-3-glucoside from urine was 90.0 ± 1.5% (n = 3); the recovery of cyanidin-3-glucoside on SPE from plasma was 91.4 ± 0.9% (n = 3).\n\nElderberry study.\n\nNo ACN peaks were detected in urine samples collected before consumption of the elderberry extract (Fig. 1A). In all samples collected from the four women after they consumed the elderberry extract, a relatively large peak at 520 nm was observed in the chromatogram with a retention time of 27 min (Fig. 1B). Compared with the profile of the mixed standard of six ACN (Fig. 1C), it appeared that this peak contained cyanidin-3-glucoside. The enlarged chromatogram indicated that it contained two peaks (Fig. 2A, Peaks 1 and 2). From the mass spectral data (Fig. 2B), we found one of them, which was eluted a little bit earlier than the other, has a molecular weight of 581.0 (mass-to-charge ratio, or m/z: 581.0). Its daughter fragment ion had an m/z of 287.2 from the MS/MS data (Fig. 2B). The other coeluting peak had an m/z of 449.1, with a daughter fragment peak with an m/z of 287.2. Comparing their elution times, spectra, and data from the previous paper (17), we identified these two peaks as cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. They are the major ACN that account for 90% of the total ACN in elderberry (24) and cyanidin is the only ACN aglycone present in elderberry (25).\n\nThere were some additional small peaks with retention times of 33–36 min. Their spectra indicated that they were also ACN. Their structures were further confirmed by MS.\n\nFIGURE 1 RP-HPLC chromatograms of urine samples from subject G before (A) and 0–2 h after consuming the elderberry extract (B). Chromatogram C is of six mixed anthocyanins: delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside from left to right on the chromatogram.\n\nANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS\n\n1867\n\nmAU\n\nPeak 2 uronide residue, which is a very common conjugated form of flavonoids in humans (26). This peak may be peonidin mono-glucuronide. However, we could not determine the exact site of glucuronidation on the peonidin from the available data. Subject G, 0-2 hour Two other small peaks (Peaks 8 and 9) which eluted earlier than Peak 7 were not identified because of their low concentrations. There was another glucuronide conjugated form with a retention time of 19.8 min on the subject G chromatogram (0 –2 h) (Fig. 4B, Peak 10). MS spectral results indicated an m/z of 625.3 and MS/MS data gave two fragments with an m/z of 463.1 and 287.2. (Fig. 4B). An m/z of 287.2 is typical for cyanidin aglycone, and 463.1 minus 287.2 is 176, which is indicative of a glucuronide residue. The difference between 463.1 and the m/z of the parent compound (625.3) is 162.2, which matches that of a hexose residue. Because only cyanidin-3-glucoside is present in elderberry, this peak should be the monoglucuronide form of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a compound which has four free hydroxyl groups. The exact glucuronidation site on cyanidin is not known. Two other peaks in the same chromatogram (Peaks 11 and 12) were not identified. They were not typical ACN based on their MS spectral data. Not all metabolites were detected in all subjects. A summary of the MS data and total urinary excretion is shown in Table 1.\n\nBlueberry study.

The poor lipophilic properties of ACN have led to the conviction that they are underabsorbed. Horwitt (11) was perhaps the first to observe the ACN pigments in the urine of rabbits. Recently, however, several investigators have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in both human and animal bodies as intact forms (12–23). Some investigators have shown that quercetin glucosides may interact with the intestinal glucose transporter and be absorbed in that manner (28–30). Whether ACN could be absorbed by a similar mechanism remains unknown. Müller et al. (22) compared the urinary excretion when elderberry ACN were consumed with and without simultaneous ingestion of sugar. The total excretion of ACN with sugar was lower than that without sugar, indicating that sugar carriers might play a role in flavonoid absorption. The presence of the sambubioside form gives strong credence to this as it is unlikely that the sambubioside form could be reformed from the aglycone after its absorption.\n\nPrevious studies have also indicated that methylation is an established pathway in the metabolism of flavonoids (26). For several flavonoids with 3, 4-dihydroxylation of ring B, conjugates of their 3-O-methyl ethers were excreted (31–32). This transformation occurred in the liver and was catalyzed by catechol-O-methyl transferase (14,33). Cyanidin is an anthocyanidin with a 3, 4-dihydroxylation pattern of ring B. We detected peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in the urine from humans. Miyazawa et al. (15) found a methylated form of an ACN in liver of rats and the concentration of the methylated form was much higher than the original form in the liver, but they did not detect it in plasma and urine. They (15) assumed that these methylated compounds were excreted from the liver into bile directly. However, we detected the methylated form of ACN in the urine of humans. Thus, they must appear in the blood and be excreted by the kidney.\n\nConjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are considered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds. They are also the common final steps in the metabolic pathway of flavonoids in mammalian systems (26,34). These modifications could start in the small intestine, liver, or kidney (35–36). UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and sulfotransferase in the liver would likely be responsible for this conjugation (26,37). So far, many different subclasses of flavonoids have been found to be absorbed and excreted as glucuronide forms in both humans and experimental animals (26,35,37,38). But for ACN, no glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms have been found in urine or plasma of either humans or experimental animals. This observation is completely different from other flavonoids, such as catechin and epicatechin, or isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein, whose basic structures are similar to ACN. Miyazawa et al. (15) assumed that the flavylium cation structure of ACN may impart resistance to such enzymatic conversion into conjugates.\n\nIn our studies we detected the glucuronide conjugate forms for the first time. These results indicate that ACN might share some of the same metabolic pathways with other flavonoid compounds. Perhaps, others did not detect them because of the low concentrations of these metabolites. We detected and tentatively identified them using diode–array detector and MS. We were unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with the enzyme β-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min). Hydrolysis of the conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in that ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared completely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h. Because previous investigators have relied on detecting the conjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations before and after incubation with β-glucuronidase, small amounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any conjugates that were present.\n\nIn this study, we still do not know how the peonidin monoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could describe the formation of this metabolite (Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-glucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to form peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).\n\nEither cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could serve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form the corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this to occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would have to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique enzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-glucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination (39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine of the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis would explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This pathway seems likely since we have found all of these compounds in urine.\n\nA second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and absorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and conjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cyanidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid (14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of humans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat jejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to find peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we have not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is that we are generally working near the limits of detection of\n\nOMe\n\nOH HO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nCyanidin aglycone Peonidin aglycone\n\nOH OMe OH\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside + CH,OH Peonidin monoglucuronide\n\nOH Pathway 2\n\nCyanidin 3-glucoside monoglucuronide Peonidin 3-glucoside\n\nOMe\n\nCOOH\n\nOH\n\nPeonidin 3-glucuronide\n\nPathway 1\n\nFIGURE 6 Glucuronide conjugated forms from cyanidin-3-glucoside.

It is clear from all but one of these studies that the recovery of ACN or ACN metabolites in urine is quite low (0.004 – 0.11% of dose). The one study in which urinary excretion was much higher (13) involved subjects who consumed wine and the “ACN-like” compounds which absorbed at 520 nm and were not well characterized. It may be that ACN in wine are absorbed to a much greater extent than from berries or berry juices or extracts.\n\nIn summary, we observed for the first time the presence of glucuronide forms of ACN, namely peonidin monoglucuronide and cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide, in the urine of humans after the consumption of elderberry ACN. We observed the apparent methylation of both cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside to peonidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-sambubioside. We were unable to detect ACN in plasma from women who consumed a single meal of blueberries; however, they were detectable in the urine but the quantities were quite low, with the total amount excreted during the first 6 h being only 0.004% of the quantity consumed.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nMazza, G. & Miniati, E.

The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 ± 90 mg (mean ± SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 ± 10.9 mg (mean ± SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.

"How do the antioxidant capacities of anthocyanins contribute to their potential health benefits, particularly in relation to chronic diseases?","['KEY WORDS:\n\nanthocyanin\n\nmetabolite\n\nelderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n\nblueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\n\nAnthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread group of plant constituents known collectively as flavonoids. They are mainly distributed among flowers, fruits and vegetables and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in flower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited because of their poor stability. As a potential major component of our daily diet (4), more and more research has concentrated on their biological activities and possible health benefits in protecting against some chronic diseases, including cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Some of these biological activities and protective functions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities (5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal chelation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\n\nTo evaluate the health benefits of ACN in humans, the bioavailability including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider the metabolites (such as ring-fission products produced by microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.) instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the concentration of the original forms in human body is much less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contribute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However, information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited. As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides, were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body unless they were hydrolyzed by intestinal microorganisms. Recently, several papers on the absorption and metabolism of dietary ACN have shown that ACN can be absorbed in experimental animals and humans as glycosides (12–23). We have previously detected the intact glycoside forms in blood and urine of humans after consuming elderberry ACN (16–17). Murkovic and coworkers (20–22) studied the absorption and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that ACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood and urine as intact glycosides. This report documents that additional ACN metabolites are present in humans after consumption of ACN from an elderberry extract or whole blueberry.\n\n0022-3166/02 $3.00 © 2002 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

What was the dosage of elderberry extract consumed by the study participants?,"['Subjects and study design. The study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee of Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, and written, informed consent was obtained from each study participant.\n\nFor the elderberry study, four healthy women, 60–70 y old, consumed 12 g elderberry extract that contained a total of 720 mg of ACN blended in 500 mL water after fasting overnight as described previously (17). Urine samples were collected from these subjects before the consumption of elderberry extract and between 0 and 2, 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12, and 12 and 24 h after consumption of the elderberry extract. The urine samples were treated with 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2, v/v) and then stored at -70°C before analysis.\n\nFor the blueberry study, six healthy elderly women, 60–70 y old, were given 189 g frozen lowbush blueberry (BB) (containing a total of 690 mg of ACN) blended in 315 mL water after fasting overnight. The urine samples were collected and treated as described above. Blood samples were collected before and at 10, 20, 30, 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after consumption of blueberry. The blood samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then plasma samples were quickly removed and immediately treated with an aqueous solution of 0.44 mol/L TFA (1:0.2; v/v).
